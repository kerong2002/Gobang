- Starting the game requires two parameters, the **IP address** of the host and the **port number**. 
- For example, you can start the game with the following command:
```py
python Gobang_server.py <ip_address> <port_number>
python Gobang_client.py <ip_address> <port_number>
# example:
python Gobang_server.py localhost 1234
python Gobang_client.py localhost 1234
```

- In the game, black moves first. You can place a piece by clicking on a position on the board with your mouse. When it is your turn to move, a prompt will appear on the screen indicating that it is your turn.

- During the game, you can right-click on the board to view the game rules and to surrender. When a player wins or surrenders, the game will end and both players will be prompted to play again.

- That's it! Enjoy playing Gobang via UDP socket.
